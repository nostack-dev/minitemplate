# MiniTemplate

Welcome to **MiniTemplate**, a lightweight, modular, and self-contained static template engine designed to streamline your project development. It allows you to manage components, themes, and templates in a simple yet efficient way without complex dependencies or setups. This README will guide you through setting up your project, working with components, and generating templates.

## Overview

MiniTemplate is a modular web template system designed to easily integrate various components. It leverages **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI**, providing a flexible and efficient structure for statically generated web applications.

## Key Features

- **Modular Components**: Reusable components like headers, sidebars, footers, and chat inputs.
- **Template-based System**: Utilize a main `template.html` file to assemble components using a simple placeholder system (e.g., `{{lowercasenameComponent}}`).
- **Custom Theming**: Quickly change themes with the `generate.sh` script or directly using the theme controller dropdown.
- **Self-contained**: No need for complex build systems or dependencies beyond basic command-line tools.

## Installation

Clone the MiniTemplate repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nostack-dev/minitemplate.git
cd minitemplate
```

Make sure all required files and directories are properly set up before proceeding.

## Usage

### Creating a New Project

To create a new project using the default template and components, you can run the `create_new_project.sh` script:

```bash
./create_new_project.sh
```

This script will prompt you to enter a project name and set up the necessary components and template in a new directory under `projects/`.

### Adding Components to Your Project

The `add_to_project.sh` script allows you to easily add components or templates to your project. To list available components or add a specific one, use:

```bash
./add_to_project.sh
```

By default, this script will list all available components from `components_converted`, `components_custom`, and `components_default`. You can then add any of them to your project by specifying the component name:

```bash
./add_to_project.sh button
```

To add default components, you can use the following command:

```bash
./add_to_project.sh defaults
```

## Component Generation

MiniTemplate allows you to generate static HTML files from templates and components using the `generate.sh` script. The script takes care of replacing placeholders with component content and adding optional theming. It supports both regular and showcase modes.

### Default Usage

Run the `generate.sh` script to generate the main `index.html` file using the default template:

```bash
./generate.sh
```

This will create an `index.html` file from the default template and components.

### Custom Themes

You can apply a custom theme by providing the theme name when running the script. For example:

```bash
./generate.sh dark
```

This will set the `data-theme` attribute in the body tag to `dark`, applying the selected DaisyUI theme.

### Showcase Mode

To generate a showcase page, which displays all available components in one view, use:

```bash
./generate.sh showcase
```

This will create a `showcase_output.html` file in the `lib` directory, which includes all the components available in the `components_source` directory.

### Handling Missing Components

During the generation process, if any components are missing, placeholders will remain in the output file. A warning will be displayed, listing the missing components.

## Custom Theming

MiniTemplate leverages the theming capabilities of DaisyUI, allowing you to create custom themes that apply consistent styling across your components.

You can modify the theme directly in your generated files by altering the `data-theme` attribute or by using the theme controller component (`themecontrollerComponent.html`) to switch between themes dynamically.

Available themes include:

- light
- dark
- cupcake
- cyberpunk
- corporate
- synthwave

You can find a full list of DaisyUI themes [here](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).

## Creating New Components

To create a new component, use the `createcomponent.sh` script, which generates the necessary HTML structure for you.

**Example**:

```bash
./createcomponent.sh button
```

This will create a new component called `buttonComponent.html` in your project. The generated component will include a `div` element with an ID corresponding to the component name and a basic structure to be customized.

## Component Generation from Input to Output in `lib/`

The `lib/` directory contains subdirectories for managing component transformations:

- **`lib/components_source/`**: Contains the source components in their base form.
- **`lib/components_converted/`**: Contains the transformed versions of the components.
- **`lib/components_custom/`**: Stores user-generated custom components.

### How It Works:

- **Transform All Components**:
  ```bash
  ./lib/convert.sh
  ```
  This reads all HTML files in `lib/components_source/` and outputs them as self-contained components in `lib/components_converted/`.

- **Generate a Custom Component**:
  ```bash
  ./lib/convert.sh customname '<custom_html>'
  ```
  This generates `lib/components_custom/[customname]customComponent.html` with your provided HTML.

## Testing

MiniTemplate includes a set of test scripts located in the `tests/` directory. You can run these tests using the `run_tests.sh` script:

```bash
cd tests
./run_tests.sh
```

The tests will ensure that components are correctly added, IDs are properly assigned, and generated output files contain all required components.
